summary: |
    An email dialog is a modal window that allows users to compose and send an email.
description: |
    The Email Dialog is created by <Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog>.
    
    On Mobile Web and Tizen, the `to` addresses, `cc` addresses, `bcc` addresses, `subject`, and `body` are 
    appended together and formatted into a `mailto:` URL. This URL typically has a limit of 
    approximately 2000 characters.

        send via the Android Gmail or K9 mail clients.
        
        The Android "Mail" app, which is only available on some handsets, will only accept one

        To use this method on Tizen, you must include the following privilege
        in the `tiapp.xml` file of your Titanium application:

        This is a public-level privilege.

events:
  - name: complete
    summary: Fired when this email dialog has completed sending an email.
    description: |
        On Mobile Web and Tizen, as the platform cannot determine whether a message has been sent or not, 
        this event fires immediately after calling open() and always reports success.
    properties:
      - name: success
        summary: |
            Indicates if the email was handled successfully.
            Returns `true` if request succeeded, `false` otherwise. Note that emails being
            deleted or saved for later do count as success.

      - name: error
        summary: Error message, if any returned. Will be undefined if `success` is `true`.
        type: String

      - name: code
        summary: |
            Error code.
            Error code will be 0 if `success` is `true`, nonzero otherwise. If the error
            was generated by the operating system, that system's error value is used.
            Otherwise, this value will be -1.
